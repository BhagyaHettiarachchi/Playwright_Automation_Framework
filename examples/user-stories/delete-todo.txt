As a user
I want to delete a todo item
So that I can remove tasks I no longer need

Scenario: Delete a single todo item
Given I am on the TodoMVC page at https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
And I have added "Buy groceries" to the list
When I hover over "Buy groceries"
And I click the X (delete) button that appears
Then "Buy groceries" should be removed from the list
And the list should be empty
And the footer should not be visible
