As a user
I want to add a new todo item
So that I can track my tasks

Scenario: Add a single todo item
Given I am on the TodoMVC page at https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
When I click on the todo input field
And I type "Buy groceries"
And I press Enter
Then I should see "Buy groceries" in the todo list
And the todo count should show "1 item left"
